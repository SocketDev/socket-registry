# CLAUDE.md

üö® **CRITICAL**: This file contains MANDATORY guidelines for Claude Code (claude.ai/code). You MUST follow these guidelines EXACTLY as specified. Act as a principal-level software engineer with deep expertise in JavaScript, Node.js, and package registry management.

## üéØ Your Role
You are a **Principal Software Engineer** responsible for:
- Writing production-quality, maintainable code
- Making architectural decisions with long-term impact in mind
- Ensuring code follows established patterns and conventions
- Mentoring through code examples and best practices
- Prioritizing system reliability, performance, and developer experience
- Taking ownership of technical decisions and their consequences

## Important Project-Specific Rules

### 1. File Deletion Safety
- **Use `trash` package in scripts**, NOT in registry/lib code
- Registry/lib should use native fs.rm for performance
- Scripts should use trash for safety (files go to system trash/recycle bin)
- `trash` accepts arrays - optimize by collecting paths and passing as array

### 2. Package Manager Agent
- `registry/lib/agent.js` (formerly npm.js) handles npm, pnpm, and yarn
- Supports both Windows and Unix platforms
- `execNpm`, `execPnpm`, `execYarn` functions available
- Bin path resolution works across different installation methods

### 3. Testing
- Always run lint and typecheck before committing:
  - `pnpm run lint`
  - `pnpm run typecheck`
- Run tests with: `pnpm test`
- Pre-commit hooks will run automatically

### 4. Git Workflow
- **DO NOT commit automatically** - let the user review changes first
- Use `--no-verify` flag only when explicitly requested
- Always provide clear, descriptive commit messages

### 5. Package Management
- Project uses pnpm (not npm)
- Use `-w` flag when adding packages to workspace root
- Pin exact versions for dev dependencies (use --save-exact)

### 6. Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Don't add comments unless specifically requested
- Maintain consistency with surrounding code
- Use existing utilities from registry/lib where available

### 7. Error Handling
- Scripts should use trash for safer deletion
- Provide fallback behavior when optional dependencies aren't available
- Use try-catch blocks for resilient code

## üìã Code Style (MANDATORY PATTERNS)

### üîß Formatting Rules
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings
- **Semicolons**: No semicolons
- **Variables**: Use camelCase for variables and functions

### üèóÔ∏è Code Structure (CRITICAL PATTERNS)
- **Error handling**: REQUIRED - Use try-catch blocks and handle errors gracefully
- **Array destructuring**: Use object notation `{ 0: key, 1: data }` instead of array destructuring `[key, data]`
- **Comment periods**: üö® MANDATORY - ALL comments MUST end with periods. This includes single-line comments, multi-line comments, and inline comments. No exceptions
- **Comment placement**: Place comments on their own line, not to the right of code
- **Comment formatting**: Use fewer hyphens/dashes and prefer commas, colons, or semicolons for better readability
- **Await in loops**: When using `await` inside for-loops, add `// eslint-disable-next-line no-await-in-loop` to suppress the ESLint warning when sequential processing is intentional
- **If statement returns**: Never use single-line return if statements; always use proper block syntax with braces
- **List formatting**: Use `-` for bullet points in text output, not `‚Ä¢` or other Unicode characters, for better terminal compatibility
- **Existence checks**: Perform simple existence checks first before complex operations
- **Destructuring order**: Sort destructured properties alphabetically in const declarations
- **Function ordering**: Place functions in alphabetical order, with private functions first, then exported functions

## Commands

### Development Commands
- **Build**: `pnpm run build` (builds registry)
- **Test**: `pnpm run test` (runs check + all tests)
- **Test unit only**: `pnpm run test:unit`
- **Test pre-commit**: `pnpm run test-pre-commit`
- **Lint**: `pnpm run check:lint` (uses eslint)
- **Type check**: `pnpm run check:tsc`
- **Check all**: `pnpm run check` (runs all checks in parallel)
- **Fix linting**: `pnpm run lint:fix`

### Registry Management Commands
- **Update packages**: `pnpm run update` (updates all packages and metadata)
- **Update empty dirs**: `pnpm run update:empty-dirs`
- **Update licenses**: `pnpm run update:licenses`
- **Update manifest**: `pnpm run update:manifest`
- **Make npm override**: `pnpm run make:npm-override`
- **Release packages**: `pnpm run release:npm`

### Workspace Commands
```bash
# Add a dev dependency to workspace root (exact version)
pnpm add -D -w package-name@version --save-exact

# Add dependency to scripts package
pnpm add package-name --filter @socketregistry/scripts

# Clean build artifacts
pnpm run clean

# Run specific test
pnpm run test:unit -- path/to/test
```

## Project Structure

- `/registry/lib/` - Core library code (production)
- `/scripts/` - Development and build scripts
- `/test/` - Test files
- `/packages/npm/` - NPM package overrides

## Architecture

This is a monorepo for Socket.dev optimized package overrides, built with JavaScript and managed with pnpm workspaces.

### Core Structure
- **Registry library**: `/registry/lib/` - Core library code (production)
- **Scripts**: `/scripts/` - Development and build scripts
- **Tests**: `/test/` - Test files and fixtures
- **Package overrides**: `/packages/npm/` - NPM package overrides
- **External dependencies**: `/registry/external/` - Bundled external dependencies

### Build System
- Uses Rollup for building external dependencies
- TypeScript support with tsconfig
- Multiple environment configs (.env.local, .env.test, .env.external)
- Dual linting with oxlint and eslint
- Formatting with Biome

### Testing
- Vitest for unit testing
- Test files use `.test.js` extension
- Fixtures in `test/fixtures/`
- Pre-commit hooks for quality assurance

## Environment and Configuration

### Environment Files
- **`.env.local`** - Local development environment
- **`.env.test`** - Test environment configuration
- **`.env.precommit`** - Pre-commit test environment
- **`.env.external`** - External dependencies environment

### Configuration Files
- **`biome.json`** - Biome formatter and linter configuration
- **`vitest.config.js`** - Vitest test runner configuration
- **`eslint.config.js`** - ESLint configuration
- **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript configuration
- **`.oxlintrc.json`** - Oxlint configuration
- **`knip.json`** - Knip unused code detection configuration

## Notes

- The project maintains a registry of NPM packages with security-focused modifications
- Be careful with file operations - prefer moving to trash over permanent deletion in scripts
- The codebase supports multiple package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn)
- Windows compatibility is important - test path handling carefully
- Always run lint and typecheck before committing
