## 📚 Fleet Standards

### Identifying users

Identify users by git credentials and use their actual name. Use "you/your" when speaking directly; use names when referencing contributions.

### Parallel Claude sessions

This repo may have multiple Claude sessions running concurrently against the same checkout, against parallel git worktrees, or against sibling clones. Several common git operations are hostile to that.

**Forbidden in the primary checkout:**

- `git stash` — shared store; another session can `pop` yours
- `git add -A` / `git add .` — sweeps files from other sessions
- `git checkout <branch>` / `git switch <branch>` — yanks the working tree out from under another session
- `git reset --hard` against a non-HEAD ref — discards another session's commits

**Required for branch work:** spawn a worktree.

```bash
git worktree add -b <task-branch> ../<repo>-<task> main
cd ../<repo>-<task>
# edit / commit / push from here; primary checkout is untouched
git worktree remove ../<repo>-<task>
```

**Required for staging:** surgical `git add <specific-file>`. Never `-A` / `.`.

**Never revert files you didn't touch.** If `git status` shows unfamiliar changes, leave them — they belong to another session, an upstream pull, or a hook side-effect.

The umbrella rule: never run a git command that mutates state belonging to a path other than the file you just edited.

### Public-surface hygiene

🚨 The four rules below have hooks that re-print the rule on every public-surface `git` / `gh` command. The rules apply even when the hooks are not installed.

- **Real customer / company names** — never write one into a commit, PR, issue, comment, or release note. Replace with `Acme Inc` or rewrite the sentence to not need the reference. (No enumerated denylist exists — a denylist is itself a leak.)
- **Private repos / internal project names** — never mention. Omit the reference entirely; don't substitute "an internal tool" — the placeholder is a tell.
- **Linear refs** — never put `SOC-123`/`ENG-456`/Linear URLs in code, comments, or PR text. Linear lives in Linear.
- **Publish / release / build-release workflows** — never `gh workflow run|dispatch` or `gh api …/dispatches`. Dispatches are irrevocable. The user runs them manually. Bypass: a `gh workflow run` with `-f dry-run=true` is allowed when the target workflow declares a `dry-run:` input under `workflow_dispatch.inputs` and no force-prod override (`-f release=true` / `-f publish=true` / `-f prod=true`) is set.
- **Workflow input naming** — `workflow_dispatch.inputs` keys are kebab-case (`dry-run`, `build-mode`), not snake_case. The release-workflow-guard hook only recognizes kebab; a `dry_run` input silently fails the dry-run bypass.

### Commits & PRs

- Conventional Commits `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — NO AI attribution.
- **When adding commits to an OPEN PR**, update the PR title and description to match the new scope. Use `gh pr edit <num> --title … --body …`. The reviewer should know what's in the PR without scrolling commits.
- **Replying to Cursor Bugbot** — reply on the inline review-comment thread, not as a detached PR comment: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -X POST -f body=…`.

### Programmatic Claude calls

🚨 Workflows / skills / scripts that invoke `claude` CLI or `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` MUST set all four lockdown flags: `tools`, `allowedTools`, `disallowedTools`, `permissionMode: 'dontAsk'`. Never `default` mode in headless contexts. Never `bypassPermissions`. See `.claude/skills/programmatic-claude-lockdown/SKILL.md`.

### Tooling

- **Package manager**: `pnpm`. Run scripts via `pnpm run foo --flag`, never `foo:bar`. After `package.json` edits, `pnpm install`.
- 🚨 NEVER use `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, or `yarn dlx` — use `pnpm exec <package>` or `pnpm run <script>` # socket-hook: allow npx
- **`packageManager` field** — bare `pnpm@<version>` is correct for pnpm 11+. pnpm 11 stores the integrity hash in `pnpm-lock.yaml` (separate YAML document) instead of inlining it in `packageManager`; on install pnpm rewrites the field to its bare form and migrates legacy inline hashes automatically. Don't fight the strip. Older repos may still ship `pnpm@<version>+sha512.<hex>` — leave it; pnpm migrates on first install. The lockfile is the integrity source of truth.
- **Monorepo internal `engines.node`** — only the workspace root needs `engines.node`. Private (`"private": true`) sub-packages in `packages/*` don't need their own `engines.node` field; the field is dead, drift-prone, and removing it is the cleaner play. Public-published sub-packages (the npm-published ones with no `"private": true`) keep their `engines.node` because external consumers see it.
- **Config files in `.config/`** — place tool / test / build configs in `.config/`: `taze.config.mts`, `vitest.config.mts`, `tsconfig.base.json` and other `tsconfig.*.json` variants, `esbuild.config.mts`. New configs go in `.config/` by default. Repo root keeps only what *must* be there: package manifests + lockfile (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`), the linter / formatter dotfiles whose tools require root placement (`.oxlintrc.json`, `.oxfmtrc.json`, `.npmrc`, `.gitignore`, `.node-version`), and `tsconfig.json` itself (TypeScript's project root anchor — the rest of the tsconfig graph extends from `.config/tsconfig.base.json`).
- **Soak window** (pnpm-workspace.yaml `minimumReleaseAge`, default 7 days) — never add packages to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in CI. Locally, ASK before adding (security control).
- **Backward compatibility** — FORBIDDEN to maintain. Actively remove when encountered.

### No "pre-existing" excuse

🚨 If you see a lint error, type error, test failure, broken comment, or stale comment **anywhere in your reading window** — fix it. Don't label it "pre-existing" and skip past. The label is a tell that you're rationalizing avoiding work; the user reads "pre-existing" the same as "I noticed but chose not to."

The only exceptions:
- The fix is genuinely out of scope (a 2000-line refactor would derail a one-line bug fix). State the trade-off explicitly and ask before deferring.
- You don't have permission (the file belongs to another session per the parallel-Claude rule).

In all other cases: fix it in the same commit, or in a sibling commit on the same branch. Never assume someone else will get to it.

### Drift watch

🚨 **Drift across fleet repos is a defect, not a feature.** When you see two socket-* repos pinning different versions of the same shared resource — a tool in `external-tools.json`, a workflow SHA, a CLAUDE.md fleet block, an action in `.github/actions/`, an upstream submodule SHA, a hook in `.claude/hooks/` — **opt for the latest**. The repo with the newer version is the source of truth; older repos catch up.

Where drift commonly hides:
- `external-tools.json` — pnpm/zizmor/sfw versions + per-platform sha256s
- `socket-registry/.github/actions/*` — composite-action SHAs pinned in consumer workflows
- `template/CLAUDE.md` `<!-- BEGIN FLEET-CANONICAL -->` block — must be byte-identical across the fleet
- `template/.claude/hooks/*` — same hook, same code
- xport.json `pinned_sha` rows — upstream submodules tracked by socket-btm
- `.gitmodules` `# name-version` annotations
- pnpm/Node `packageManager`/`engines` fields

How to check:
1. If you're editing one of these in repo A, grep the same thing in repos B/C/D. If A is older, bump A first; if A is newer, plan a sync to B/C/D.
2. `socket-registry`'s `setup-and-install` action is the canonical source for tool SHAs. Diverging from it is drift.
3. `socket-repo-template`'s `template/` tree is the canonical source for `.claude/`, CLAUDE.md fleet block, and hook code. Diverging is drift.
4. Run `pnpm run sync-scaffolding` (in repos that have it) to surface drift programmatically.

Never silently let drift sit. Either reconcile in the same PR or open a follow-up PR titled `chore(sync): cascade <thing> from <newer-repo>` and link it.

### Code style

- **Comments** — default to none. Write one only when the WHY is non-obvious to a senior engineer. **When you do write a comment, the audience is a junior dev**: explain the constraint, the hidden invariant, the "why this and not the obvious thing." Don't label it ("for junior devs:", "intuition:", etc.) — just write in that voice. No teacher-tone, no condescension, no flattering the reader.
- **Completion** — never leave `TODO` / `FIXME` / `XXX` / shims / stubs / placeholders. Finish 100%. If too large for one pass, ask before cutting scope.
- **`null` vs `undefined`** — use `undefined`. `null` is allowed only for `__proto__: null` or external API requirements.
- **Object literals** — `{ __proto__: null, ... }` for config / return / internal-state.
- **Imports** — no dynamic `await import()`. `node:fs` cherry-picks (`existsSync`, `promises as fs`); `path` / `os` / `url` / `crypto` use default imports. Exception: `fileURLToPath` from `node:url`.
- **HTTP** — never `fetch()`. Use `httpJson` / `httpText` / `httpRequest` from `@socketsecurity/lib/http-request`.
- **Subprocesses** — prefer async `spawn` from `@socketsecurity/lib/spawn` over `spawnSync` from `node:child_process`. Async unblocks parallel tests / event-loop work; the sync version freezes the runner for the duration of the child. Use `spawnSync` only when you genuinely need synchronous semantics (script bootstrapping, a hot loop where awaiting would invert control flow). When you do need stdin input: `const child = spawn(cmd, args, opts); child.stdin?.end(payload); const r = await child;` — the lib's `spawn` returns a thenable child handle, not a `{ input }` option. Throws `SpawnError` on non-zero exit; catch with `isSpawnError(e)` to read `e.code` / `e.stderr`.
- **File existence** — `existsSync` from `node:fs`. Never `fs.access` / `fs.stat`-for-existence / async `fileExists` wrapper.
- **File deletion** — route every delete through `safeDelete()` / `safeDeleteSync()` from `@socketsecurity/lib/fs`. Never `fs.rm` / `fs.unlink` / `fs.rmdir` / `rm -rf` directly — even for one known file. Prefer the async `safeDelete()` over `safeDeleteSync()` when the surrounding code is already async (test bodies, request handlers, build scripts that await elsewhere) — sync I/O blocks the event loop and there's no benefit when the caller is awaiting anyway. Reserve `safeDeleteSync()` for top-level scripts whose entire flow is sync.
- **Edits** — Edit tool, never `sed` / `awk`.
- **Inclusive language** — see [`docs/references/inclusive-language.md`](docs/references/inclusive-language.md) for the substitution table.
- **Sorting** — sort alphanumerically (literal byte order, ASCII before letters). Applies to: object property keys (config + return shapes + internal state — `__proto__: null` first); named imports inside a single statement (`import { a, b, c }`); `Set` / `SafeSet` constructor arguments; allowlists / denylists / config arrays / interface members. Position-bearing arrays (where index matters) keep their meaningful order. Full details in [`docs/references/sorting.md`](docs/references/sorting.md). When in doubt, sort.
- **`Promise.race` / `Promise.any` in loops** — never re-race a pool that survives across iterations (the handlers stack). See `.claude/skills/promise-race-pitfall/SKILL.md`.
- **`Safe` suffix** — non-throwing wrappers end in `Safe` (`safeDelete`, `safeDeleteSync`, `applySafe`, `weakRefSafe`). Read it as "X, but safe from throwing." The wrapper traps the thrown value internally and returns `undefined` (or the documented fallback). Don't invent alternative suffixes (`Try`, `OrUndefined`, `Maybe`) — pick `Safe`.
- **`node:smol-*` modules** — feature-detect, then require. From outside socket-btm (socket-lib, socket-cli, anywhere else): `import { isBuiltin } from 'node:module'; if (isBuiltin('node:smol-X')) { const mod = require('node:smol-X') }`. The `node:smol-*` namespace is provided by socket-btm's smol Node binary; on stock Node `isBuiltin` returns false and the require would throw. Wrap the loader in a `/*@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__*/` lazy-load that caches the result — see `socket-lib/src/smol/util.ts` and `socket-lib/src/smol/primordial.ts` for canonical shape. **Inside** socket-btm's `additions/source-patched/` JS (the smol binary's own bootstrap code), use `internalBinding('smol_X')` directly — that's the C++-binding access path and it's guaranteed available there.

### 1 path, 1 reference

A path is constructed exactly once. Everywhere else references the constructed value.

- **Within a package**: every script imports its own `scripts/paths.mts`. No `path.join('build', mode, …)` outside that module.
- **Across packages**: package B imports package A's `paths.mts` via the workspace `exports` field. Never `path.join(PKG, '..', '<sibling>', 'build', …)`.
- **Workflows / Dockerfiles / shell** can't `import` TS — construct once, reference by output / `ENV` / variable.

Three-level enforcement: `.claude/hooks/path-guard/` blocks at edit time; `scripts/check-paths.mts` is the whole-repo gate run by `pnpm check`; `/path-guard` is the audit-and-fix skill. Find the canonical owner and import from it.

### Background Bash

Never use `Bash(run_in_background: true)` for test / build commands (`vitest`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `tsgo`). Backgrounded runs you don't poll get abandoned and leak Node workers. Background mode is for dev servers and long migrations whose results you'll consume. If a run hangs, kill it: `pkill -f "vitest/dist/workers"`. The `.claude/hooks/stale-process-sweeper/` `Stop` hook reaps true orphans as a safety net.

### Judgment & self-evaluation

- If the request is based on a misconception, say so before executing.
- If you spot an adjacent bug, flag it: "I also noticed X — want me to fix it?"
- Fix warnings (lint / type / build / runtime) when you see them — don't leave them for later.
- **Default to perfectionist** when you have latitude. "Works now" ≠ "right."
- Before calling done: perfectionist vs. pragmatist views. Default perfectionist absent a signal.
- If a fix fails twice: stop, re-read top-down, state where the mental model was wrong, try something fundamentally different.

### Error messages

An error message is UI. The reader should fix the problem from the message alone. Four ingredients in order:

1. **What** — the rule, not the fallout (`must be lowercase`, not `invalid`).
2. **Where** — exact file / line / key / field / flag.
3. **Saw vs. wanted** — the bad value and the allowed shape or set.
4. **Fix** — one imperative action (`rename the key to …`).

Use `isError` / `isErrnoException` / `errorMessage` / `errorStack` from `@socketsecurity/lib/errors` over hand-rolled checks. Use `joinAnd` / `joinOr` from `@socketsecurity/lib/arrays` for allowed-set lists. Full guidance in [`docs/references/error-messages.md`](docs/references/error-messages.md).

### Token hygiene

🚨 Never emit the raw value of any secret to tool output, commits, comments, or replies. The `.claude/hooks/token-guard/` `PreToolUse` hook blocks the deterministic patterns (literal token shapes, env dumps, `.env*` reads, unfiltered `curl -H "Authorization:"`, sensitive-name commands without redaction). When the hook blocks a command, rewrite — don't bypass.

Behavior the hook can't catch: redact `token` / `jwt` / `access_token` / `refresh_token` / `api_key` / `secret` / `password` / `authorization` fields when citing API responses. Show key _names_ only when displaying `.env.local`. If a user pastes a secret, treat it as compromised and ask them to rotate.

Full hook spec in [`.claude/hooks/token-guard/README.md`](.claude/hooks/token-guard/README.md).

### Agents & skills

- `/security-scan` — AgentShield + zizmor audit
- `/quality-scan` — quality analysis
- Shared subskills in `.claude/skills/_shared/`

#### Skill scope: fleet vs partial vs unique

Every skill under `.claude/skills/` falls into one of three tiers — surface this distinction when adding a new skill so it lands in the right place:

- **Fleet skill** — present in every fleet repo, identical contract everywhere. Examples: `path-guard`, `quality-scan`, `security-scan`, `updating`, `programmatic-claude-lockdown`, `promise-race-pitfall`. New fleet skills land in `socket-repo-template/template/.claude/skills/<name>/` and cascade via `node socket-repo-template/scripts/sync-scaffolding.mts --all --fix`. Track them in `SHARED_SKILL_FILES` in the sync manifest.
- **Partial skill** — present in the subset of repos that need it, identical contract within that subset. Examples: `cursor-bugbot` (every repo with PR review), `updating-xport` (every repo with `xport.json`), `squashing-history` (repos with the squash workflow). Live in each adopting repo's `.claude/skills/<name>/`. When you change one, propagate to the others.
- **Unique skill** — one repo only, bespoke to that repo's domain. Examples: `updating-cdxgen` (sdxgen), `updating-yoga` (socket-btm), `release` (socket-registry). Never canonical-tracked; the host repo owns it end-to-end.

Audit the current classification with `node socket-repo-template/scripts/run-skill-fleet.mts --list-skills`.

#### `updating` umbrella + `updating-*` siblings

`updating` is the canonical fleet umbrella that runs `pnpm run update` then discovers and runs every `updating-*` sibling skill the host repo registers. The umbrella is fleet-shared; the siblings are per-repo (or partial — e.g. `updating-xport` lives in every repo with `xport.json`). To add a new repo-specific update step, drop a new `.claude/skills/updating-<domain>/SKILL.md` and the umbrella picks it up automatically — no edits to `updating` itself.

#### Running skills across the fleet

`scripts/run-skill-fleet.mts` (in `socket-repo-template`) spawns one headless `claude --print` agent per fleet repo, in parallel (concurrency 4 by default), with the four lockdown flags set per the *Programmatic Claude calls* rule above. Per-skill profile table maps known skills to sensible tool/allow/disallow lists; override with `--tools` / `--allow` / `--disallow`. Per-repo logs land in `.cache/fleet-skill/<timestamp>-<skill>/<repo>.log`. Use `Promise.allSettled` semantics — one repo's failure doesn't abort the rest.

```bash
pnpm run fleet-skill updating                     # update every fleet repo
pnpm run fleet-skill quality-scan --concurrency 2 # slower, more conservative
pnpm run fleet-skill --list-skills                # classify skills fleet/partial/unique
```

<!-- END FLEET-CANONICAL -->

## 🏗️ Registry-Specific

### Architecture

- `/registry/src/` — TypeScript source
- `/registry/dist/` — build output (esbuild)
- `/scripts/` — dev/build scripts (all `.mts`)
- `/test/` — test files/fixtures
- `/packages/npm/` — NPM package overrides
- Primary export: `getManifestData(ecosystem, packageName)` from `@socketsecurity/registry`

### Performance

- Optimize for speed without sacrificing correctness (serves Socket security infrastructure)
- Benchmark performance-sensitive changes
- Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths

### Package Manager Spawning

- Lives in `@socketsecurity/lib/spawn`, not this repo.

### Commands

- Dev: `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run test`, `pnpm run check`, `pnpm run fix`
- Type check: `pnpm run type` (tsgo, no emit)
- Registry: `pnpm run update`, `pnpm run make-npm-override`, `pnpm run release-npm`
- Test npm packages: `node scripts/npm/test-npm-packages.mts` (long-running)

### Build System

- esbuild (registry); TypeScript → CommonJS (unminified for Node ESM interop)
- Post-build transform converts esbuild wrappers to clear `module.exports = { ... }` for Node ESM named imports
- Env configs: `.env.test`
- Lint: oxlint. Format: oxfmt.

### Cross-Platform (MANDATORY)

- Must work on Windows + POSIX
- Paths: always `path.join()`, `path.resolve()`, `path.sep` — never hard-code `/` or `\`
- Temp: `os.tmpdir()` + `fs.mkdtemp()`
- File URLs: `fileURLToPath()` from `node:url`

### Node.js Compatibility

- Minimum: Node.js 18.0.0
- **FORBIDDEN ES2023+**: `toReversed()`, `toSorted()`, `toSpliced()`, `with()`
- Use `slice().reverse()`, `slice().sort()` instead

### Git Workflow

- Pre-commit: `pnpm run fix && pnpm run check`
- `--no-verify`: safe for scripts/workflows/tests/docs; always run hooks for lib/packages
- Batch commits: first with hooks, rest with `--no-verify` (after fix + check)
- Messages: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) — `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- **NO AI attribution** in commit messages
- **Open PRs:** when adding commits to an OPEN PR, ALWAYS update the PR title and description to match the new scope. A title like `chore: foo` after you've added security-fix and docs commits to it is now a lie. Use `gh pr edit <num> --title "..." --body "..."` (or `--body-file`) and rewrite the body so it reflects every commit on the branch, grouped by theme. The reviewer should be able to read the PR description and know what's in it without scrolling commits.

### Git SHA Management

- 🚨 **NEVER GUESS SHAs**: use `git rev-parse HEAD` or `git rev-parse origin/main`
- Format: `@662bbcab1b7533e24ba8e3446cffd8a7e5f7617e # main` (full 40-char SHA)
- GitHub Actions require pinned full SHAs

### GitHub Actions SHA Pin Cascade

Layer definitions and cascade procedure: see `.claude/skills/updating-workflows/` — command `/update-workflows`, full reference at `.claude/skills/updating-workflows/reference.md`.

Actions and workflows reference each other by full 40-char SHA pinned to main. When any action changes, update consumers in layer order (Layer 1 → 2a → 2b → 3 → 4) via separate PRs. Each PR must merge before the next.

- Each layer gets its own PR — never combine layers
- 🚨 **NEVER type/guess SHAs** — `git fetch origin main && git rev-parse origin/main` AFTER merge
- 🚨 **NEVER use a SHA from a PR branch** — only SHAs from main after merge
- Verify SHA: `gh api repos/SocketDev/socket-registry/commits/<sha> --jq '.sha'`
- **Propagation SHA** = whatever `.github/workflows/_local-not-for-reuse-*.yml` currently pin. That's the source of truth for external repos:

  ```bash
  grep -hE 'SocketDev/socket-registry.*@[0-9a-f]{40}' .github/workflows/_local-not-for-reuse-*.yml \
    | grep -oE '@[0-9a-f]{40}' | sort -u
  ```

  Expect **exactly one** SHA. More than one = Layer 4 bump incomplete; finish it before propagating.

- L3/L4-only changes (reusable workflow edits, no L1/L2 action changes): skip to Layer 4 bump
- Don't clobber third-party SHAs during blanket replacements
- Consumer repos: **direct push** — socket-btm, sdxgen, stuie, ultrathink; **PR** — socket-cli, socket-lib, socket-sdk-js, socket-packageurl-js. Note: `sdxgen` local checkout is `socket-sdxgen/` but GitHub repo is `SocketDev/sdxgen` — use bare name for `gh` commands. `stuie` local checkout is `socket-tui/` but GitHub repo is `SocketDev/stuie`.

### CI Testing Infrastructure

- **MANDATORY**: Use `SocketDev/socket-registry/.github/workflows/ci.yml@<SHA>` with full commit SHA
- Reusable workflows centralize lint/type-check/test/coverage
- Matrix: Node.js 22/24, cross-platform
- CI script naming: `lint-ci`, `test-ci`, `type-ci` (no watch/fix modes)

### GitHub Actions

- **MANDATORY**: actions reference commit SHAs, not tags — `uses: owner/repo@sha # vX.Y.Z`
- Standard SHAs: actions/checkout@v5, pnpm/action-setup@v4, actions/setup-node@v5, actions/upload-artifact@v4
- 🚨 **NEVER use `sed` (or `awk`/`perl -i`/other stream editors) to edit YAML workflow files** — use the Edit tool, one occurrence at a time, with `replace_all` when the old_string is unique. This applies even for "safe-looking" bulk swaps like SHA bumps across many files — `sed` silently clobbers quoting/indentation on lines the regex wasn't designed for, and failures are invisible until CI parses the file. If the swap spans many files, loop over them with Edit calls, not a single `sed -i`.

### Testing

- Dirs: `test/npm/` (NPM package tests), `test/registry.test.mts` + `test/packages.test.mts` (registry-level)
- Utils: `test/utils/` — `setupNpmPackageTest()`, `itOnWindows/itOnUnix/normalizePath()`, `expect*` helpers, `createTypeCheckerTests()`
- Coverage: **MANDATORY** — never decrease; `c8 ignore` must include reason ending with period
- Commands: `pnpm test`, `pnpm test path/to/file.test.ts`, `pnpm run cover`, `node scripts/npm/test-npm-packages.mts`
- 🚨 **NEVER use `--` before test paths** — runs ALL tests
- **NEVER write source-scanning tests** (reading source files and asserting on contents). Write functional tests that verify behavior.

### Vitest Configuration

- Config: `.config/vitest.config.mts` (used by `pnpm test`). Uses forks for isolation.
- Pool: `pool: 'forks'`, `singleFork: true`, `maxForks: 1`, `isolate: true`
- Threads: `singleThread: true, maxThreads: 1`
- Timeouts: `testTimeout: 60_000, hookTimeout: 60_000`
- Cleanup: `await safeDelete(paths)` from `@socketsecurity/lib/fs`

### Package Management

- **pnpm only** (not npm)
- Add deps: `pnpm add <pkg> --save-exact` (exact versions, no `^`/`~`)
- Workspace root: `-w` flag
- After editing `package.json` deps: run `pnpm install`, commit `pnpm-lock.yaml`, never manually edit it
- READMEs use `pnpm install`

### Script Wrappers

- Wrap complex commands in `scripts/*.mts`, not package.json directly: `"script-name": "node scripts/script-name.mts"`
- Use `spawn` from `@socketsecurity/lib/spawn` with signal handling
- Set `process.exitCode`; never call `process.exit()` except at entry point
- `.mts` scripts declare types inline; only write `.d.mts` for legacy `.mjs` utilities
- Prefer single scripts with flags (`pnpm run build --watch`) over variants (`build:watch`)

### Documentation

- Location: `docs/` (monorepos also `packages/*/docs/`)
- Filenames: `lowercase-with-hyphens.md` (except README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md)
- Style: pithy, direct, scannable; ASCII diagrams for complex concepts

### Error Handling

- `catch (e)` not `catch (error)`
- Messages: double quotes, descriptive, actionable, NO periods at end
- Patterns:
  - `"{field}" is required` / `"{field}" is a required {type}`
  - `"{field}" must be a {type}`
  - `{context} "{field}" {violation}`
  - `failed to parse {format}` / `unable to {action} "{component}"`
- Throw errors (no silent failures); include `{ cause: e }` when wrapping; no `process.exit()` except script entry
- JSDoc: `@throws {ErrorType} When condition.`

### Dependency Alignment

- Core: @typescript/native-preview (tsgo), @types/node, typescript-eslint (unified only)
- DevDeps: @dotenvx/dotenvx, @vitest/coverage-v8, del-cli, eslint, eslint-plugin-\*, globals, husky, knip, lint-staged, npm-run-all2, oxfmt, taze, type-coverage, vitest, yargs-parser, yoctocolors-cjs
- **FORBIDDEN**: separate `@typescript-eslint/*` packages; use unified `typescript-eslint`
- **TSGO PRESERVATION**: never replace tsgo with tsc
- Update: `pnpm run taze`

### Scratch Documents

- Location: `.claude/` (gitignored) — working notes, never commit
