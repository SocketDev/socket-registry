> A collection of [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev/) optimize package overrides
> for use with [`@socketregistry/cli`](https://docs.socket.dev/docs/socket-cli).

## About

In the spirit of the [e18e](https://e18e.dev/) initiative each override may fit
into one or more of the following categories:

- Cleanup âœ¨ â€” _Reduces dependencies by replacing with stubs. For instance,
  polyfills are replaced by their built-in counterparts._
- Levelup ðŸ§© â€” _Adds new features and uses the latest platform APIs._
- Speedup âš¡ â€” _Focuses on performance. Gotta go blazingly lightning fast._
- Tuneup ðŸ”§ â€” _Address CVE vulnerabilities, especially in packages that are low
  to no maintained, providing secure, reliable alternatives._

Each override is

- ðŸ’¯ tested against the original package's unit tests to ensure compatibility
- Interopbable with CommonJS
- Ships with
  <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"><img src="./ts.svg" height="20px" title="This package contains built-in TypeScript declarations" alt="TypeScript icon, indicating that this package has built-in type declarations"></a>
  TypeScript types
- Supports current and [LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) Node
  versions
