## Installation

### Install as a package override

[`socket`](https://socket.dev/npm/package/socket) CLI will automagically âœ¨
populate
[overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)
and [resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions) of
your `package.json`.

```sh
npx socket optimize
```

Prefer to do it yourself? Add `@socketregistry/is-string` to your
`package.json`.

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "is-string": "npm:@socketregistry/is-string@^1"
  },
  "resolutions": {
    "is-string": "npm:@socketregistry/is-string@^1"
  }
}
```

### Install as a plain dependency

Install with your favorite package manager.

```sh
npm install @socketregistry/is-string
```
