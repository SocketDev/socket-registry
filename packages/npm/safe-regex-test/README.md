## Installation

### Install as a package override

[`socket`](https://socket.dev/npm/package/socket) CLI will automagically âœ¨
populate
[overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)
and [resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions) of
your `package.json`.

```sh
npx socket optimize
```

`package.json`.

  }
}
```
